Agriculture, the practice of cultivating plants and rearing animals to provide food and other products, is arguably the most important economic activity in Africa. It plays a major role in the production of food that ensures sustenance of life and environmental preservation, amongst other things.

In this project, we take a look at the trend of agricultural productivity in Africa between 2004 and 2013 â€“ major producers, major consumers, trends in production and supply.
